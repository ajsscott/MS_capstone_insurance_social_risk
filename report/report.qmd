## Introduction

### Research Question

How does the probability of experiencing rent burden vary across NYC neighborhoods, after accounting for demographic and socioeconomic differences — and how much of this variation is explained by boroughs, census tracts, and spatial proximity?

## Literature Review

### The Importance of Measuring Housing Cost Burden

-   Define **rent burden** as spending \>30% of income on rent.
-   Summarize its significance in **housing policy, urban equity, and planning**.
-   Motivate the need for **fine-grained, neighborhood-level estimates**.
-   Highlight NYC as a critical case: extreme variation in burden, inequality, and housing market pressures.

### Challenges in Estimating Rent Burden at Small Spatial Scales

-   ACS as the main data source: **rich in detail but limited in precision** at the tract level.
-   Explain how **sampling error and small sample sizes** affect reliability.
-   Review critiques of using ACS tract-level estimates without accounting for **uncertainty or spatial dependence**.

### Small Area Estimation and Multilevel Modeling Approaches

-   Introduce **small area estimation (SAE)** as a statistical response to sparse local data.
-   Review **Fay-Herriot models** and **Bayesian hierarchical models** for proportions or counts.
-   Highlight applications using ACS data to estimate poverty, unemployment, or housing outcomes.
-   Emphasize **partial pooling** and **shrinkage** as tools to stabilize noisy tract-level estimates.

### Spatial Statistical Models and Urban Inequality

-   Explain the need to account for **spatial autocorrelation** in urban settings.
-   Describe **Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) models** and the **Besag–York–Mollié (BYM)** formulation.
-   Cite examples where spatial models improved small-area estimates for health, crime, homelessness, or housing variables.
-   Discuss findings that **spatially structured residuals reveal important policy-relevant patterns** (e.g., spillovers, clustering).

### Handling ACS Measurement Error and Margins of Error in Modeling

-   Present literature emphasizing **integration of MOEs** or survey design features into regression models.
-   Explain **measurement error modeling** within a Bayesian framework.
-   Highlight importance of propagating uncertainty from predictors (e.g., income, poverty) as well as outcomes.

### Limitations of Prior Work and Opportunities for Innovation

-   Prior models often:

    -   Ignore **spatial correlation**
    -   Do not model **binomial outcomes directly**
    -   Omit **MOEs** for covariates or use post-hoc smoothing

-   Few studies apply **full Bayesian spatial models** to *rent burden* specifically—especially for NYC at the tract level.

-   No studies found that simultaneously model:

    -   Binomial outcome + MOE covariates
    -   Tract-level + borough-level + spatial structure

### Positioning This Study in the Literature

-   Your model bridges multiple strands:

    -   **SAE** via hierarchical structure
    -   **Spatial modeling** via CAR priors
    -   **Survey uncertainty** via latent covariates

-   Your work advances the literature by:

    -   Providing **posterior credible estimates of rent burden** at high resolution
    -   Quantifying and visualizing **uncertainty**
    -   Comparing **flat, hierarchical, and spatial model variants**

-   Strong contribution to:

    -   **Urban policy analysis**
    -   **Statistical methodology for public data**
    -   **Applied Bayesian modeling**
