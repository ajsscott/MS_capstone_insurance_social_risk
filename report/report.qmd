## Introduction

This study investigates the phenomenon of "transit deserts"—areas where marginalized demographic groups (e.g., low-income, Black, and Latino populations) face systemic disadvantages in access to public transportation, jobs, and essential amenities. Using high-resolution American Community Survey (ACS) data and transit network data (GTFS), we apply unsupervised graph-based clustering (Leiden algorithm) and geospatial network analysis (OSMnx) to detect and quantify these inequities. The project introduces a novel accessibility disparity index (ADI) to measure gaps in transit access and evaluates policy interventions to mitigate algorithmic redlining in urban planning.

### Research Questions
    -  Can unsupervised learning (Leiden algorithm) identify distinct clusters of transit access inequities across NYC block groups? How do these clusters correlate with demographic variables (income, race, occupation)?
    -   What are the key structural factors (e.g., transit frequency, job proximity, last-mile connectivity) that contribute to transit deserts? Do historically redlined neighborhoods exhibit persistent transit access disparities?

## **Abstract**  
This study investigates the phenomenon of "transit deserts"—areas where marginalized demographic groups (e.g., low-income, Black, and Latino populations) face systemic disadvantages in access to public transportation, jobs, and essential amenities. Using high-resolution American Community Survey (ACS) data and transit network data (GTFS), we apply **unsupervised graph-based clustering (Leiden algorithm)** and **geospatial network analysis (OSMnx)** to detect and quantify these inequities. The project introduces a novel **accessibility disparity index (ADI)** to measure gaps in transit access and evaluates policy interventions to mitigate algorithmic redlining in urban planning.

## **Research Questions**  
1. **Detection & Mapping**:  
   - Can unsupervised learning (Leiden algorithm) identify distinct clusters of transit access inequities across NYC block groups?  
   - How do these clusters correlate with demographic variables (income, race, occupation)?  

2. **Mechanisms & Disparities**:  
   - What are the key structural factors (e.g., transit frequency, job proximity, last-mile connectivity) that contribute to transit deserts?  
   - Do historically redlined neighborhoods exhibit persistent transit access disparities?  

3. **Policy Implications**:  
   - How might transit agencies use this framework to prioritize infrastructure investments in underserved areas?  
   - Can predictive modeling simulate the equity impacts of proposed transit expansions?

# **Methodology Outline**  

## **1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**  
### **Datasets:**  
- **ACS 2023** (merged/geocoded): Demographic, income, occupation, and commuting behavior.  
- **GTFS (MTA & Other NYC Transit Feeds):** Real-time transit schedules, stops, and routes.  
- **OpenStreetMap (OSMnx):** Street networks, pedestrian pathways, and amenity locations (jobs, healthcare, schools).  

### **Preprocessing Steps:**  
- **Geospatial Joining:** Link ACS block groups to nearest transit nodes.  
- **Network Construction:** Build a multimodal transit graph (subway, bus, walking) with OSMnx.  
- **Accessibility Metrics:** Compute:  
  - **Job accessibility** (number of jobs reachable within 30 mins).  
  - **Frequency-weighted transit coverage** (stops × service hours).  
  - **Last-mile disconnectivity** (distance from transit to key amenities).  

## **2. Unsupervised Learning for Transit Desert Detection**  
### **Graph-Based Clustering (Leiden Algorithm)**  
- **Input Features:**  
  - Transit accessibility scores.  
  - Demographic variables (% low-income, % Black/Latino, vehicle ownership).  
- **Method:**  
  - Construct a **k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph** from feature space.  
  - Apply **Leiden algorithm** (resolution-optimized community detection) to identify transit desert clusters.  
  - Validate clusters via **silhouette score** and spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I).  

### **Interpretability (SHAP + Spatial Regression)**  
- Use **SHAP values** to rank feature importance in cluster formation.  
- Fit a **spatial error model (SEM)** to assess whether transit deserts persist after controlling for income/race.  

## **3. Equity Analysis & Policy Tools**  
### **Accessibility Disparity Index (ADI)**  
- Formula:  
  \[
  ADI = \frac{\text{Transit Access (High-Income Areas)} - \text{Transit Access (Low-Income Areas)}}{\text{Max Transit Access}}
  \]  
- **Visualization:** Heatmaps of ADI across NYC, overlaid with historical redlining maps.  

### **Interactive Policy Simulator (Dash/Leaflet)**  
- A web tool allowing planners to:  
  - Simulate new transit routes/stops and predict ADI changes.  
  - Identify priority zones for equity-focused interventions.

## **Expected Contributions**  
1. **Technical:**  
   - Novel integration of **Leiden algorithm** for transit equity analysis.  
   - Open-source Python pipeline for replicability in other cities.  
2. **Policy:**  
   - Evidence-based framework for targeting transit investments.  
   - Quantification of "algorithmic redlining" in mobility systems.  

## **Timeline**  
| Phase | Tasks | Duration |  
|--------|--------------------------------|------------|  
| 1 | Data collection & network modeling | 3 weeks |  
| 2 | Graph clustering & disparity analysis | 4 weeks |  
| 3 | Causal inference (historical redlining effects) | 2 weeks |  
| 4 | Policy simulator development | 3 weeks |  

## **Next Steps**  
- Refine clustering features (e.g., include eviction data for displacement risk).  
- Partner with NYC transit advocacy groups for validation.  

This project bridges **computational urban science**, **transportation equity**, and **algorithmic fairness**—areas absent from your prior work. Let me know if you'd like to adjust the emphasis (e.g., deeper causal analysis vs. tool development).
