## Abstract

-   Introduce the importance of predictive modeling for auto insurance risk.
-   Highlight the integration of **NYC crash data and ACS socio-economic data** via APIs.
-   Summarize the use of **gradient boosting models and SHAP explainability**.
-   Note the inclusion of **advanced geospatial and interactive visualizations** for insights.

## 1. Introduction 

### 1.1 Context and Motivation 

\* Briefly highlight the importance of accurate insurance risk modeling for pricing and risk management.

\* Introduce NYC as a complex urban environment with abundant open data (MVC crash data and ACS socio-economic indicators) that can serve as proxies for insurance claims risk.

### 1.2 Limitations of Traditional Methods 

\* Note the constraints of traditional actuarial models (e.g., GLMs) in capturing nonlinear relationships and socio-economic variability.

\* Mention the need for more flexible, data-driven approaches.

### 1.3 Machine Learning Approach 

\* Introduce gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) as powerful ML techniques for risk prediction.

\* Briefly emphasize the role of SHAP explainability in making ML outputs interpretable for insurers.

### 1.4 Research Gap and Objectives 

\* State the gap: lack of integrated studies using public crash and socio-economic data with explainable ML .

\* Research question: \*Which socio-economic and transportation-related features most strongly influence crash-related insurance risk outcomes in New York City?\*

\* Key contributions: predictive modeling, SHAP-based explainability, and advanced geospatial visualizations.

Objectives and research question: identifying socio-economic and transportation factors influencing claim frequency/severity.

Outline remaining sections.

## 2. Related Work 

### 2.1 Machine Learning in Insurance Risk Modeling 

\* Transition from traditional actuarial models to ML:

\* Discuss the limitations of generalized linear models (GLMs) and actuarial pricing techniques in capturing nonlinear relationships between variables like driving behavior, socio-economic factors, and claims.

\* Cite studies that show improved predictive performance of ML methods (e.g., gradient boosting, random forests, neural networks) over traditional methods in auto insurance risk.

\* Applications of gradient boosting:

\* Highlight prior research on XGBoost and LightGBM for predicting claim frequency, severity, or fraud detection in insurance.

\* Emphasize the importance of boosting methods for handling mixed data types (categorical + continuous) and interpretable feature importance .

### 2.2 Use of Crash and Socio-Economic Data 

\* Crash data as a proxy for claim frequency:

\* Support the argument that crash severity and frequency strongly correlate with insurance claims (cite studies using police reports, telematics, or open data as predictors).

\* Integration of socio-economic features:

\* Review studies showing how income, commuting patterns, and vehicle ownership affect driving risk and claim likelihood.

\* Include evidence of regional disparities in crash frequency linked to demographics and urban infrastructure.

\* NYC-specific or urban data studies:

\* Reference prior research analyzing transportation risk factors in large urban environments (NYC, Chicago, or similar).

### 2.3 Geospatial Analytics in Risk Assessment 

\* Spatial heterogeneity of risk:

\* Cite work that demonstrates how crash risks and claim rates vary spatially due to road design, population density, and socio-economic clustering.

\* Include examples of geospatial analysis applied to insurance pricing or traffic safety interventions .

\* Techniques used:

\* Contrast traditional spatial clustering (e.g., Moranâ€™s I, k-means) with modern ML approaches that incorporate spatial features.

### 2.4 Explainability in Machine Learning Models 

\* The importance of interpretability in insurance ML models:

\* Highlight the regulatory and business requirement for explainable AI in high-stakes fields like insurance pricing and underwriting.

\* Applications of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):

\* Cite literature where SHAP is applied to interpret ML models in finance, insurance, or risk analytics.

\* Discuss the benefits of SHAP over traditional feature importance metrics (e.g., accounting for interactions between features).

### 2.5 Gaps in the Literature

\* Lack of studies combining socio-economic and crash data with gradient boosting:

\* Point out that while ML is used in insurance, few studies integrate publicly available crash data (NYC MVC) with ACS socio-economic features for claim risk modeling.

\* Need for advanced visualization and explainability:

\* Argue that previous work often neglects interpretable dashboards or SHAP-driven analysis that stakeholders can use for policy decisions.
